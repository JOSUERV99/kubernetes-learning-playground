Lessons 

- Worker nodes are like airplane terminals, where passengers board
    - The cluster works with at least 3 worker nodes
    - Where are programmed and executed, and each worker node has three components
        - Kubelet
            - an agent that runs on every worker node
            - make sure that containers in a pod are running and healthy
            - communicates directly with the API server in the control plane
            - looking for newly assigned pods
            - pull the image from the image repo
        - Container runtime
            - once the kubelet assigned to the new pod starts a container using CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
            - enable CRI to create containers with the engines
                - containerd
                - CRI-O 
                - Kata Containers
                - AWS Firecracker
        - Kube proxy
            - Make sure pods and services can communicate with each other in the control plane
            - Each proxy communicates directly with the Kubeapi server
